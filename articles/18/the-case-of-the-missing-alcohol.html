  <h1 class="title">The Case of the Missing Alcohol Proton</h1>
  <p class="byline">February 27, 2018</p>

  <p>I recently performed a <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Sodium_dichromate">sodium dichromate</a>
oxidation of 2-butanol to 2-butanone<label for="butanoloxd" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="butanoloxd" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/oxidation-2-butanol.png"><br></span>.</p>

<p>For reasons soon to be mentioned, I thought my attempt at this reaction had
failed miserably, and so I decided to accept and forget. But a few days later I
examined my experimental data - where I expected an alcohol proton in my NMR,
there was none to be found!</p>

<h2 id="h--the-experiment">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#h--the-experiment">#</a><span class="el">H:</span>  The Experiment</h2>

<p>The oxidation was performed via fractional distillation, with 2-butanone
expected to distill in the 77-85°C range. I used 2.5mL butanol as my limiting
reagent, and anticipated a modest ~2mL crude distillate.</p>

<p>I collected less than 0.5mL. Perhaps my setup was just very low-yielding? I ran
an IR and submitted an NMR sample. The IR suggested the collected <em>“product”</em>
was almost entirely 2-butanol. I decided to run the experiment again,
double-checking each step of the procedure.</p>

<p>Again, less than 0.5mL product was collected. I sighed, and st-</p>

<p><span class="newthought">What the hell?</span> 
Gas was evolving from my apparatus! Turns out, the distillation head had a small
hole at the bottom of its thermometer joint<label for="thrm" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="thrm" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Likely from someone
attaching a thermometer too violently. </span>. This explained the lack of
product, but this time I could not run the reaction again - less than an hour
remained in the lab period, there were no spare distillation heads, and I would
still have to purify my product and collecting a melting point.</p>

<p>I cleaned up and headed out, forgetting to retract my bad NMR sample.</p>

<h2 id="he--the-data">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#he--the-data">#</a><span class="el">He:</span>  The Data</h2>

<p>A couple days later, I received the NMR spectra for my submitted product, which
I knew was actually 2-butanol. And that’s when it got interesting.</p>

<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/assets/img/nmr-2-butanol.png"><figcaption><code>1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm:</code><br><code>2.45 (t, 2H), 2.14 (s, 3H), 1.70 (s, 1H), 1.06(d, 3H)</code></figcaption></figure>
<p><br>
Do you see it? Almost every hydrogen is accounted for - the signals at <code class="highlighter-rouge">2.14</code>ppm
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.06</code>ppm correspond to the molecule’s methyl groups, at <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.70</code>ppm is the hydrogen adjacent
the alcohol<label for="upfield" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="upfield" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">This proton should actually be further downfield.<br><br> </span>,
and at <code class="highlighter-rouge">2.45</code>ppm are the protons of the third carbon<label for="solvent" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="solvent" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">The minute rise at <code>7.27</code> is the solvent, CDCl<sub>3</sub>. </span> -
but the alcohol proton is missing!</p>

<p>So where did it go? An argument could be made that the NMR sample was
impure, producing a bad spectra. While this may be true, even in a poor
spectrum one can expect the protons of the sample to have at least a small
presence<label for="goodnmr" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="goodnmr" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/nmr-2-butanol-PURE.png"><br>For completeness, here is a spectrum of pure 2-butanol.</span>.</p>

<p>In fact, there is a far more interesting solution this puzzle.</p>

<h2 id="li--hydrogen-bonding-and--oh-shifts">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#li--hydrogen-bonding-and--oh-shifts">#</a><span class="el">Li:</span>  Hydrogen Bonding and -OH Shifts</h2>

<p>The alcohol group of 2-butanol is susceptible to hydrogen bonding, but
hydrogen bonds are dynamic and constantly changing. This produces a fairly large
variability in electron density around the alcohol proton, leading to a broad
range of potential chemical shifts<label for="addit" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="addit" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">This type of behavior
extends to most functional groups exhibiting hydrogen or other dynamic
bonding, including amines. </span> (roughly between 2 and 5 ppm).</p>

<p>It may seems crazy, but this suggests that the alcohol proton is really just
hidden amongst the doublet or triplet at <code class="highlighter-rouge">2.45</code>ppm and <code class="highlighter-rouge">2.14</code>ppm, respectively.
At least, that’s my best theory<label for="better" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="better" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">If you know of a better
one, please <a href="mailto:ayaz.hafiz.1@gmail.com?subject=A%20theory%20for%20the%20missing%20alcohol">let me know</a>! </span>,
and it absolutely blows my mind.</p>
