  <h1 class="title">Equivalence Matters</h1>
  <p class="byline">September 2, 2019</p>

  <p>I recently wrote about
<a href="./smart-is-not-a-good-word">why “smart” is not a good word</a>. You don’t
necessarily need to read that post to understand this one; the main idea is that
“smart” is usually used as a supercategory abstracting and trivializing
multiple, orthogonal subcategories.</p>

<p>A natural follow-up to this statement is why “smart” not being a good word
matters. The reasoning I previously presented is that usage of “smart” at best
ambiguates the word’s intent, and at worst provides no useful information at
all. But there are more interesting reasonings.</p>

<p>In this post, I propose that “smart” not being a good word matters because
value-categorizing words like “smart” are also <em>bad</em> words, and that the
categorizations these words attempt to delineate are dangerous to individuality.</p>

<h3 id="0--preconditions">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#0--preconditions">#</a><span class="el">0:</span>  Preconditions</h3>

<p>First, it’s important to note that this is a discussion about people. And people
are defined by some practical factors, including <strong>time</strong> and <strong>philosophy</strong>.
There are some people with a lot of time and non-binding philosophies, but I am
speaking on the scale of all people, and it is not the case that all people have
infinite time and no philosophies.</p>

<p>I mention <strong>time</strong> partly as a concession and partly as a segue. Limited time
make categories a necessity - considering the nuances of every situation without
using categorical assumptions results in exponential, and potentially unbounded,
time investment. For instance, it is much easier to decide whether or not to
cook pesto pasta given a general like or dislike towards pesto and pasta than it
is to consider all other ingredients in the dish, its environmental and health
implications, its monetary investment, etc. That’s not to say these other
considerations aren’t important; they are, because they introduce nuances that
may dramatically impact estimations made from categorical assumptions.</p>

<p>So <strong>philosophy</strong> also becomes a factor. Individuals will focus their time on
categories they perceive to be valuable. Of course, these choices are unique.</p>

<p>I argue that philosophy is not only
individual<label for="phi" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="phi" class="margin-toggle">
<span class="marginnote">
Certainly, this statement is itself biased by my individual philosophies.</span>
 -
it becomes externally important when individuals use their philosophies to make
decisions impacting others. In claiming that value categorizations are
dangerous, there is a precondition of my philosophy on externalities.</p>

<p><label for="my-values" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="my-values" class="margin-toggle">
<span class="marginnote">
I only claim these to be my values, but I see little motivation for
disagreeing with such values without a philosophy of rational egoism.</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe that actions that stifle the opportunities of individuals to make
personal decisions are dangerous and should not be made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe people should do things that empowers the opportunities and values of
others. This is hard to always do, but I believe that value categories make it
nearly impossible.</p>

<h3 id="1--equalizing-values">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#1--equalizing-values">#</a><span class="el">1:</span>  Equalizing Values</h3>

<p>Different people have different perceptions of value. One way to decide what
decisions empower the opportunities and values of others is to create a
universal listing of value categorizations. Of course, this is impossible
because of the near-infinite number of category permutations. An alternative is
to treat all individuals as computationally equivalent and all individuals’
values as value-equivalent, or more simply, as value-less. In this model,
external value assignment becomes obsolete. For instance, a Level 16 CEO and a
Level 1 employee in a company are
equivalent<label for="even-further" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="even-further" class="margin-toggle">
<span class="sidenote">
My philosophy of equivalence goes further; I claim that e.g. a human and a rock have the same complexity and value.</span></p>

<p>and of equal value, even if cultural norms claim otherwise.</p>

<h3 id="2--dangerous-categories">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#2--dangerous-categories">#</a><span class="el">2:</span>  Dangerous Categories</h3>

<p>External value assignment is dangerous because it entirely defeats computational
equivalence, which in turn defeats unambiguous value perception. That’s a long
sentence to say assigning values on others totally voids their desired
perception of value.</p>

<p>Because value categorization <em>is</em> value assignment, value categorization is
dangerous.</p>

<h3 id="3--int">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#3--int">#</a><span class="el">3:</span>  Int</h3>

<p>Okay, so that’s my
proof<label for="proof" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="proof" class="margin-toggle">
<span class="sidenote">
I mean, this is kind of how I think. Or at least I
think I do.</span>
. Here’s something for intuition.</p>

<p>Consider some individual working a job that societal norms may generally
prescribe as prestigious. Others in the same environment as that individual may
have jobs that societal norms prescribe as less prestigious. Prescribing any
value to the kind of job that each individual has turns out to be useless for
each individual’s self-worth and self-valuation because, generally speaking,
each individual has their own motivations for doing their job. Attempts to
externally classify the value of another’s work discards the nuances behind that
individual’s decision to do their work, and furthermore assigns a
non-self-prescribed value not necessarily representative of how the individual
chooses to view themselves.</p>

<p>To me, that’s not a great way to let others live their
lives<label for="lorde" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="lorde" class="margin-toggle">
<span class="marginnote">
I recently read Audrey Lorde’s <a href="https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/11881_Chapter_5.pdf"><em>The Uses of the Erotic</em></a>. It discusses marginalization of the erotic in women, presenting interesting ideas somewhat tangential to this post, and reads in ~thirty minutes.</span>
.
Sure, the individual may have value attributions to what they do, but it’s not
up to the rest of us to make those attributions. Normative statements can be
useful, but I think they should be avoided where they marginalize an
individual’s experience.</p>

<p>Anyway, those are just some of my thoughts. I may be wrong, but that’s okay. I
only hope this can provide a perspective.</p>
