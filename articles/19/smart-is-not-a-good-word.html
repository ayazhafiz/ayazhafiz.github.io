 <h1 class="title">"Smart" Is Not a Good Word</h1>
<p class="byline">July 18, 2019</p>

<article class="post">
  <p>I grew up not understanding mental illness. Like
<a href="https://medium.com/@junwu_46652/the-intelligence-myth-8b5722145180">Jun Wu</a>, I
found studying this domain to be self-actualizing — anxiety and clinical
depression had not been anomalies, but intrinsic parts of my childhood.</p>

<p>I’m now somewhere around 20 years old and persistence of least the latter is
ubiquitous in my daily life.</p>

<p>My experiences with mental health have been the result of many influences. One
of the most important influences has been the notion of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code>ness. I’ll
discuss my interpretation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code>, then explain why I think it’s not a good
word.<span class="note"><label for="definitely" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label></span><input type="checkbox" id="definitely" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">I use the
word “definitely” frequently in this post, not as an emphasis but as a synonym for “confidently”.</span></p>

<h3 id="u--school-rules">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#u--school-rules"></a><span class="el">u:</span>  School Rules</h3>

<p>I grew up in an extremely competitive school district. Exemplifications of this
include</p>

<ul>
  <li>some of my friends began competing their SAT scores in the 7<sup>th</sup>
grade;</li>
  <li>having a 4.0 GPA would not guarantee that you were in the academic top 10% of
the student body;</li>
  <li>student leadership positions were often explicitly granted on a combined
prestige and quid pro quo basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is not always that such an environment exists. The problem is that
for a student that has spent all of their primary education experience in such
an environment, it is very likely the only environment they know exists. I still
sometimes feel that it is the only environment that matters.</p>

<p>Viewers<span class="note"><label for="viewers" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="viewers" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">e.g. parents, teachers</span> would compliment many
in this environment for their intelligence, and of course, for being <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code>.
Maybe it is already obvious that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code> is not a good word for this - 80 hour
academic work weeks, at any age, is not necessarily an indication of
intelligence. It can only definitely be an indication of hard work.</p>

<p>But also, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code>ness doesn’t have anything to do with intelligence.</p>

<h3 id="s--dj-benzi">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#s--dj-benzi"></a><span class="el">s:</span>  DJ Benzi</h3>

<p>What does being <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code> even mean? In my experience, people use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code> to
simultaneously describe to someone’s prowess in a certain skill and their
overall intelligence.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that knowledge of a particular domain and general
intelligence have almost nothing to do with each other. The reality is that you
and I are probably very knowledgeable in respective (but different!) knowledge
areas, and also probably have nearly-equal intelligences. Lumping the two
together means that a a listener who hears something about an individual’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code>s has to either</p>

<ol>
  <li>treat <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code>ness as a score of both domains, or</li>
  <li>ask more questions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Deference to the latter is least-ambiguous, but the presence of ambiguity at all
means this usage of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code> is already not a good pattern.</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/benzi">DJ Benzi</a> is one of the most clever and
knowledgeable individuals in their
field<span class="note"><label for="dj-benzi" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="dj-benzi" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">From my perspective. There are many other clever and
knowledgeable individuals in this domain as well. I just wrote this listening to Benzi.</span>.
From Benzi’s perspective, I imagine there is one domain that he would consider me
clever and knowledgeable in. I also believe that both of us have equal<span class="note"><label for="highly-similar" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="highly-similar" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">or at least definitely highly-similar</span>
intelligences.</p>

<p>Maybe someone could say DJ Benzi and I are both smart. What does that tell you?</p>

<h3 id="t--computational-equivalence">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#t--computational-equivalence"></a><span class="el">t:</span>  Computational Equivalence</h3>

<p>The thing is, I’m pretty sure all entities in the environments around us are
computationally
equivalent<span class="note"><label for="tcomputations" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="tcomputations" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Derived from the theory of computation, itself an idea <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/">popularized</a> by Stephen Wolfram.</span>,
which is the idea that structures are identical in their design complexity
though their functionality may be radically
different<span class="note"><label for="opt" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label></span><input type="checkbox" id="opt" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">My interpretation of computational equivalence is a very
optimistic one. It may be the case that this model can be absolutely refuted, but it is the most
generic appeal to logic I currently have.</span>.</p>

<p>Treating all entities as computationally equivalent generalizes influences on
functionality. In this model, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">intelligence</code> is as not good of a word as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code>
is. It becomes easy to show that the only
differentiators<span class="note"><label for="this-disc" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="this-disc" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">as related to this discussion</span>
between any two entities are the knowledge domains they operate in.</p>

<p>This means the cumulative domain signature an entity operates in must be
globally unique. Perception of something as “difficult” or “interesting” is an
artifact of contrasting domain signatures, though in fact every domain is
equally complex. This is the model I employ for reasoning why different people
find problems to be “difficult” or “interesting”<span class="note"><label for="ethnoc" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="ethnoc" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">This can be thought of as generalizing a context of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnocentrism">ethnocentrism</a>.</span>.</p>

<p>“Passion” is also solved by this model. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>’s “passion” is an artifact of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>’s
perception of contrasting structural distribution. Structures may be more or
less rare, but they are still all equivalent in complexity. It’s even possible
to generalize that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>’s passion is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>’s computational signature.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s an unbound idea. The point is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code> is not a good word. Maybe
it’s even a bad word.</p>
