great for my workflow but may not necessarily carry over to yours. I encourage
you to use this article as one perspective to pick-and-choose from in your
configuration development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Learning curve</em></strong>: All the tools I mention here have a learning curve, the
magnitude of which varies but is largely due to learning keybindings. I will
say that once one learns to work with <code>vim</code> effectively, most other
keyboard-based softwares are fairly easy to pick up, as many have similar
semantics to <code>vim</code>. Tips from personal experience can be found in
<a href="#31--vims-learning-curve">section 3.1</a>.</p>

<p>I work on a 15&quot; 2016 MBP. It's a really nice machine I was fortunate enough to
buy with scholarship money a couple years back, and does nicely pretty much
everything one buys a Mac for.</p>
<p>As I've become more productive, I've increasingly turned to power tools like
<code>vim</code>, <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux"><code>tmux</code></a>, and most recently,
<a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm"><code>chunkwm</code></a><span class="note"><label for="chunkwm" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="chunkwm" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">A tiling window manager for macOS</span>.
<code>chunkwm</code> in particular has been a big jump for me in terms of productivity and
workspace aesthetic. This post discusses my macOS configuration, motivated by my
setup of <code>chunkwm</code>.</p>
<p>My configuration files are available on GitHub at
<a href="https://github.com/ayazhafiz/hmcd">ayazhafiz/hmcd</a>.</p>

<h2 id="1%3A-chunkwm-and-skhd-for-tiling-windows" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#1%3A-chunkwm-and-skhd-for-tiling-windows" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class='el'>1:</span>  <code>chunkwm</code> and <code>skhd</code> for tiling windows</h2>
<p>First, a definition - <strong>tiling window managers</strong> organize windows in
compartmentalized buffers on a desktop, and often support handling windows on
multiple desktops and monitors. I find this management useful for multitasking
because the wm will automatically attempt to place new windows in an optimal
spot, with the user having to adjust window sizes and locations only ad-hoc. A
side effect of these managers is the orthogonal aesthetic they provide to one's
desktop, though the value of that may vary by taste. I quite like it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm"><code>chunkwm</code></a> is a tiling wm for macOS. On
its own it's pretty nice, but its full potential comes out with a hotkey daemon
like <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd"><code>skhd</code></a>, which maps keystrokes to
arbitrary system actions. <code>skhd</code> can be used for mapping hotkeys to
<code>chunkc</code><span class="note"><label for="chunkc" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="chunkc" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">the program that sends messages to <code>chunkwm</code></span>
commands, enabling window management via just the keyboard.</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/skhd-chunkwm.gif' width='100%'/><figcaption>manipulating windows with skhd</figcaption></figure>
<p><code>chunkwm</code> provides a configuration file for setting window gaps, border offsets,
border colors, and other aesthetic features; <code>skhd</code> has a configuration file for
hotkey
bindings<span class="note"><label for="skhdrc-more" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label></span><input type="checkbox" id="skhdrc-more" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">The nice thing about <code>skhd</code> is keybindings can act on more than just <code>chunkc</code> - for instance, I have bindings for opening a terminal and web browser.</span>.
I've made public my personal
<a href="https://github.com/ayazhafiz/hmcd/blob/master/.chunkwmrc"><code>.chunkwmrc</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ayazhafiz/hmcd/blob/master/.skhdrc"><code>.skhdrc</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="2%3A-alacritty-as-a-terminal-and-tmux-as-its-multiplexer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#2%3A-alacritty-as-a-terminal-and-tmux-as-its-multiplexer" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class='el'>2:</span>  <code>alacritty</code> as a terminal and <code>tmux</code> as its multiplexer</h2>
<p>Right now I use <a href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty"><code>alacritty</code></a> as my terminal
emulator<span class="note"><label for="alacritty" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="alacritty" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">For a while I used <a href="https://hyper.is/"><code>hyper</code></a>, but people are right about the Electron bloat. I've heard good things about <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty"><code>kitty</code></a>, but haven't had the chance to use it.</span>.
It's great -- fast as hell, not a battery leech, and has nice configuration
options with extensible keybindings (you can see my configuration
<a href="https://github.com/ayazhafiz/hmcd/blob/master/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml">here</a>).
Especially with a transparent background and color palettes generated by
<a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal"><code>wal</code></a>, it's easily the most beautiful
application on my machine.</p>
<p>Why <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux"><code>tmux</code></a>? It may seem ridiculous to nest
terminal sessions within windows within a window manager, but I use <code>tmux</code> to
have just one terminal window open and manage various sessions inside it. <code>tmux</code>
sessions persist independently of the emulator they are run in, so you can enter
and exit them anytime you want.</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/tmux.gif' width='100%'/><figcaption>working with multiple tmux sessions</figcaption></figure>
<p><code>tmux</code> allows for aesthetic and keybinding configurations via a <code>.tmux.conf</code>. Of
course, I've made mine
<a href="https://github.com/ayazhafiz/hmcd/blob/master/.tmux.conf">publicly avaliable</a>.</p>
<h2 id="3%3A-power-tools%3A-vim-and-ranger" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#3%3A-power-tools%3A-vim-and-ranger" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class='el'>3:</span>  Power tools: <code>vim</code> and <code>ranger</code></h2>
<p>For a while, I thought <code>vim</code> was a needlessly cumbersome tool, as I'm sure most
do initially. Once I began to seriously use it though, I realized my enhancement
in productivity, and now I use <code>vim</code> for pretty much
everything<span class="note"><label for="neovim" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="neovim" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">More accurately, I use <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim"><code>neovim</code></a>.</span>.
Working with only a keyboard certainly imposed a learning curve, but has paid
off in a a tremendous speedup for literally everything I do on my machine. In
fact, the productivity benefits <code>vim</code> has provided me are the primary reason I
switched to a key-bound tiling wm and and now do 90% of my work in a terminal
emulator.</p>
<p>On a similar note, the <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger"><code>ranger</code> filemanager</a>
provides <code>vim</code>-like key bindings for browsing file systems. This is a boon for
productivity -- at least over <code>Finder</code>, in my experience.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a beautiful, extensible text editor to replace your IDEs
and speedup your workflow, I cannot recommend <code>vim</code>
enough<span class="note"><label for="vim" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="vim" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><code>emacs</code> is also really nice, if that's more your thing. Regardless, the advantage of keybindings is undeniable -- there's a reason <code>VS Code</code> and <code>Atom</code> have command palettes.</span>.
And once you get hooked on that, check out <code>ranger</code>. And if you're trying to get
really deep, maybe you even want a command-line email client like
<a href="http://www.mutt.org/"><code>mutt</code></a>. There's an entire world out there for you to
discover <img class='emoji' alt='smile' src='https://gitlab.com/ayazhafiz/emoji-img/raw/master/public/emoji/unicode/1f604.png' height=20 width=20></img>.</p>
<h3 id="3.1%3A-vim's-learning-curve" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#3.1%3A-vim's-learning-curve" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class='el'>3.1:</span>  <code>vim</code>'s Learning Curve</h3>
<p><code>vim</code>'s learning curve kinda sucks if you haven't worked much with key-bound
applications before. Getting over that hill is a personal journey, but I have
two tips from personal experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>vimtutor</code> is your best friend. Launch it up in your command line and go
through all of it; the tutorial isn't very long and will teach you everything
you need to be functional in <code>vim</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actually use <code>vim</code>. Make it the exclusive workspace for your next few
projects, homework assignments, papers, whatever else. At first it might
really suck and you might want to switch back editors, but soon <em>it'll click</em>
and you'll begin to experience why it's raved about so much. Non-toy usage of
<code>vim</code> will also teach you all the tricks <code>vimtutor</code> doesn't and force you to
configure the editor to your liking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Speaking of configuration,
<a href="https://github.com/ayazhafiz/hmcd/blob/master/.vimrc">here's my <code>.vimrc</code></a>. Like
the other configurations I've made public, you should use it only to pick and
choose what you need - my preferences and plugins probably don't exactly align
with your needs, and it's useful to know what the commands you're including
actually mean.</p>
<h2 id="00%3A-postlude" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#00%3A-postlude" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class='el'>00:</span>  Postlude</h2>
<p>I hope this article has provided you with an additional perspective on macOS
configuration options. If you choose to incorporate any of the tools I've
discussed in your own workflow, that's awesome! Though of course, my
configuration is by no means is the &quot;right&quot; way to setup a workspace -- hell,
this one constantly evolves as my needs and preferences change.</p>
<p>If you find my configurations useful, have comments about this discussion, have
another perspective you'd like share, or anything else related, [please ping
me](mailto:ayaz.hafiz.1@gmail.com?subject=Re: Your macOS workspace with a tiling
wm). I'd love to chat.</p>
