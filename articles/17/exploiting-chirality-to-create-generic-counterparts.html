  <h2 id="h--the-dilemma">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#h--the-dilemma"></a><span class="el">H:</span>  The Dilemma</h2>

<p>Say you go to a pharmacy to place an order for a prescription, only to wonder
why you’re about to pay \$60 for twenty tablets when the generic
version offers twice as many for $30. But then you wonder, is a generic
pharmaceutical <em>really</em> the same as its private counterpart? Amazingly, the
answer is yes<span class="note"><label for="really" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="really" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">…mostly.</span>.</p>

<h2 id="he--a-legal-problem">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#he--a-legal-problem"></a><span class="el">He:</span>  A Legal Problem</h2>

<p>The primary issue in creating a generic version of a private drug is making sure
that the chemical composition of whatever compound is formed is not identical to
that of any competitor’s<span class="note"><label for="not-identical" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label></span><input type="checkbox" id="not-identical" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">This mostly regards
pharmaceuticals created in developed countries, where patent laws are well
enforced.</span>. On first glance, this seems very difficult to accomplish, since
generic equivalents have to be made of the same active ingredient(s) as their
private equivalents. Luckily, there is a powerful facet of organic chemistry
that allows for the accomplishment of such a task:</p>

<h2 id="li--chirality">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#li--chirality"></a><span class="el">Li:</span>  Chirality</h2>

<p>A hugely important aspect in the understanding and appreciation of molecular
structures, chirality refers to the asymmetric, non-superimposable relationship
between two otherwise identical compounds. This is likely best understood with
an example:</p>

<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/assets/img/chirality.png"><figcaption>(S)-1-bromoethanol and (R)-1-bromoethanol</figcaption></figure>
<p><span class="note"><label for="s-r-naming" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label></span><input type="checkbox" id="s-r-naming" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><em>S</em> and
<em>R</em> refer to the stereochemical geometry at a molecule’s chiral center. It is a
convenient way to distinguish stereoisomers, based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Ingold%E2%80%93Prelog_priority_rules">CIP priority rules</a>.</span></p>

<p>It is obvious that these two compounds are the same
formulaically<span class="note"><label for="bromoethanol" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="bromoethanol" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">1-bromoethanol</span>. But geometrically,
they are very different! The two compounds’ hydrogens and bromines are in
different spatial configurations, arranged in such a way they <strong>never be
superposed</strong> on one other, no matter how they are twisted or turned. Any two
compounds with this property are known as <strong>stereoisomers</strong>. In this particular
case, the two compounds are a special type of stereoisomers, known as
<strong>enantiomers</strong><span class="note"><label for="stereoisomers-specific" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="stereoisomers-specific" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Stereoisomers of a molecule
are <strong>enantiomers</strong> if they have different configurations at each of their
equivalent stereocenters, and if the molecule does not have an internal plane of
symmetry. Enantiomers with an internal plane of symmetry are known as <strong>meso</strong>.
Stereoisomers with different configurations at some, but not all, of their
equivalent stereocenters are known as <strong>diastereomers</strong>.</span>.</p>

<p>Here’s where it gets interesting.</p>

<p>See, enantiomers are identical with regard to their physical properties, except
in one quality - optical rotation. Each enantiomer rotates polarized light by
the same magnitude, but in opposite directions. This makes enantiomers
fundamentally <strong><em>different compounds</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This means that one enantiomer can be produced without infringement on the
registered sale of another, while providing the same physical properties<span class="note"><label for="works" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label></span><input type="checkbox" id="works" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">One enantiomer of a drug will be as medically useful as its
counterpart, so long as there is no bias among drug receptors.</span>.</p>

<p>But as the margin notes, there is another problem here, because certain
receptors in our bodies only respond to particular molecular geometries. In that
case, what is a stereoisomer to do?</p>

<h2 id="be--the-hack">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#be--the-hack"></a><span class="el">Be:</span>  The Hack</h2>

<p>Recall the following fact:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enantiomers rotate polarized light by the same magnitude, but in opposite
directions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the basis for how generic drugs can get away with it. The trick is to
mix equal amounts of each enantiomer, creating a <strong>racemate</strong> - an optically
inactive<span class="note"><label for="optically-inactive" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label></span><input type="checkbox" id="optically-inactive" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><strong>Optically inactive</strong> mixture or
compound does not rotate light - in this case, because the direction
of rotation by each enantiomer cancels out.</span> mixture of enantiomers. This
way, a drug can be made that contains the active ingredient required for its
operation, but is <em>different enough</em> in its physical properties and composition
from a private counterpart to be competitively acceptable.</p>

<p>So, next time you’re buying medication, save some money with the generic
version and a doubled dosage!</p>
