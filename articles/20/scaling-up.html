<h1 class="title">Scaling Up</h1>
<p class="byline">March 29, 2020</p>

<article class="post">
  <p>There’s this not-so-novel idea that a businesses will often find success by focusing on inputs
rather than outputs. The reasoning is that outputs are affected by many more externalities
that inputs, and that a strong application of a business’s inputs will naturally lead to
desired outputs. For example, a salesperson may wish to focus more on the number of meetings they
set up rather than their conversion rate<span class="note"><label for="number-meetings" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="number-meetings" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">The latter is less
deterministic than the former, and finding success in the former will lead to a larger number of
conversions anyway.</span>.</p>

<p>But business must consider a number of other strategies, including how to scale up.
Observing the current<span class="note"><label for="current" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="current" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">At the time of this writing</span> COVID-19 pandemic, I
have become convinced that effective scaling is a pivotal consideration for all organizations, not
just businesses, and will play a tremendous role in the pandemic’s impact on human livelihoods. I’ll
give just three examples (you could find many more!):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Insurance premiums will soar after (and possibly during) this pandemic. Part of this will be
because a lot of people will get sick and insurance companies need to maintain short-term
profitability. Part of this is that insurance companies, like many nations’ healthcare systems,
are unprepared to scale for catastrophe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the pandemic begins to stabilize, many individuals will need convenient, flexible
sources of income. Businesses in the gig economy, like rideshare and delivery apps, will be
stressed to intake a tremendous userbase without meticulous foresight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I planned to immigrate to Switzerland in May, prior to the nation’s suspension of work visas.
Due to an increased backlog and higher workload, Swiss consulates estimate the processing time of
a visa to increase to over a month<span class="note"><label for="month" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="month" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span>​<script type="math/tex">\sim4\text{x}</script></span> the regular
processing time</span> after the suspension is lifted. Could this timeline
be improved with a buffer, like delaying the start date of an issued visa?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I anticipate that we will think about scale much more as COVID rages on, and that scaling solutions
will resurge as a <a href="/articles/20/satellites#4--fact">fact</a> in a post-COVID world. Part of the
difficulty with scaling is that it is not cheap, and without an expectation for long-term need,
arguments for scalability are dulled. It will be interesting to see how these challenges are solved.
My bet is on an economy of platforms and services.</p>

<p>Generalizing<span class="note"><label for="generalization" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label></span><input type="checkbox" id="generalization" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Pun intended <img class="emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" src="https://gitlab.com/ayazhafiz/emoji-img/raw/master/public/emoji/unicode/1f642.png" height="20" width="20"></span> the idea of
“scaling up”, one can thinking about going from a specialization to a generalization. Scale in this
sense can be very individual – it’s one thing to understand how much salt a scrambled egg requires,
it’s another to understand the same for an arbitrary dish.</p>
