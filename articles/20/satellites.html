 <h1 class="title">Satellites</h1>
<p class="byline">February 29, 2020</p>

<article class="post">
  
  <p>At some point, all fads were satellite ideas pursued by one more independent groups. As a fad grows,
so does the size and number of groups associated with it. Eventually a fad achieves a non-trivial
adoption rate (becomes a fact) or fades away (becomes an artifact).</p>
<p>The relationships of groups pursuing an idea at all of these stages is well studied, especially
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827114003709">with</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956522104000272">respect</a>
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/isr/article-abstract/11/3/523/1796789?redirectedFrom=fulltext">to</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complexity_of_Cooperation">collaboration and competition</a><span class="note"><label for="four-links" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="four-links" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">These are four separate links</span>.
In this cc, I wish to briefly discuss the consequences of each of these stages on individual
productivity and efficiency. Let's start from the back.</p>
<h2 id="4%3A-fact" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#4%3A-fact" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class='el'>4:</span>  Fact</h2>
<p>Intuition might suggest that productivity is lowered significant after a fad becomes a fact. But
while there may not be a lot of effort required in growing the fact to a greater level of adoption,
maintenance is non-trivial. For example, the upfront cost of building a new house is high, but this
cost is marginal relative to the maintenance costs required over the better part of the next
century<span class="note"><label for="maintenance" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="maintenance" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Maintenance requires both individual contribution (time) and
transient contributions (e.g. via money paid for services) of productivity.</span>.</p>
<p>An individual may expect a consistent maintenance cost associated with a fact. This cost is likely
to be small compared to an individual's other responsibilities, and an increase in maintenance costs
incites an individual to develop optimizations<span class="note"><label for="maintenance-cost" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="maintenance-cost" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">E.g. a system
that requires a lot of manual tuning is likely to be superseded.</span> (read: new satellite ideas).
This can lead to a cycle of individual effort invested in an idea.</p>
<h2 id="3%3A-artifact" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#3%3A-artifact" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class='el'>3:</span>  Artifact</h2>
<p>When a fad becomes an artifact, an individual has two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Invest more time in the artifact. This boosts individual productivity, but is
inefficient when the fad has been shown to be flawed. For example, <a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/NamedTensor.html">untyped tensors</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pivot to another idea. This may lead to a loss of productivity in the short term due to ramp-up
investment, but increases efficiency in the long term.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aside these considerations, the productivity invested in an artifact is very similar to that of a
fact.</p>
<h2 id="2%3A-fad" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#2%3A-fad" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class='el'>2:</span>  Fad</h2>
<p>Okay, so here's where it gets interesting. I'm not convinced that being involved with a fad is
productive.</p>
<p>What's the hot thing right now? Whatever it is, I'm sure there are a lot of people working on it.
Realistically, if any one individual working on that fad ceased their contribution immediately,
whatever they could have discovered would be independently discovered in the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_minutes_of_fame">15 minutes of
fame</a>.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong -- 10% contributions add up. But for the individual, 10% isn't always enough.
This seems like a degradation in individual efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="1%3A-satellite" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#1%3A-satellite" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class='el'>1:</span>  Satellite</h2>
<p>Naturally, satellite ideas require a large efficiency investment. Whether this translates to
heightened productivity is largely dependent on personal motivation.</p>
<p>Satellites are lonely. Work on divergent ideas must be self-motivated, as invested dependents
are often lacking. When a road map is unclear (as is often the case for satellite ideas), it can be
difficult to convince oneself to be going. So a satellite must be really into it.</p>
<p>I feel that this facet is often overlooked. Revolutionary ideas are good ideas, and they are also
incredibly unique and obsessively pursued. In fact, uniqueness and investment are the primary
factors that can promote a satellite into a fad. The soundness of an idea becomes more important
only later on.</p>
