 <h1 class="title">Heterogeneity in Volunteering</h1>

<p>I went volunteering this past weekend for the first time since late March 2020
(around when the covid-19 pandemic began taking large swing in the U.S.).</p>

<p>What are the characteristics of an individual who, during a pandemic, goes to
volunteer at a home for those experiencing homelessness? In my opinion, such an
individual is fairly invested in volunteering in this space. But what
surprised me about this session was the vast diversity of my fellow volunteers’
motivations for volunteering at the home.</p>

<p>A senior couple told me they were excited to give someone a meal and help
contribute to the home’s rehabilitation program.
They wanted to see men experiencing homelessness get an education, find a job, and obtain
stable housing. The two, working with their local church, produce personal care
bags handed out to those they see living on the streets. Only once has a
recipient of a bag asked them for money instead<span class="note"><label for="bag" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="bag" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">This surprised me a lot. My
first impression was this would an example of giving presumed help, not the help
someone actually needs.</span>.</p>

<p>A lawyer 25 years my senior said she was there to say hi to the men, many of
whom were now her close friends. As a side effect of her contribution for the
day, she would take home the egg shells and cardboard cartons for thirty dozen
eggs, which she gave to her composting and flower-growing neighbors
respectively. Why was she volunteering at this home? Well, it is quite
enjoyable and meaningful as a sense of community for her. In
fact, aside her apartment, this is the only indoor location she has been in since
the pandemic has taken large swing; she has not even ordered food in.</p>

<p>As for me, I came because I wanted to speak to men experiencing homelessness
and learn how the pandemic has affected their livelihoods. It was my first time at
this home, and I wanted to learn about the experiences of the administrators of
the home, how the home operates, what the men in the home find challenging about
the home’s operations, and what unique initiatives the home drives.</p>

<p>I list these motivations because they are very different, well-formed
perspectives.
Perhaps I had not noticed such diversities in reasoning in
previous volunteerings, perhaps I needed a several-month break, perhaps
this diversity is just characteristic to a group of individuals that would
volunteer in such a time, or perhaps something else.</p>

<p>In previous volunteerings, I found that the motivations of my fellow volunteers were
often “non-interesting” – they were there to complete a requirement, try something new,
or just learn about a cause. For me, new insights and perspectives would come
from those impacted by the volunteering, and rarely from my peers.</p>

<p>This time, I learned the most from my peers. This was such a great thing! I
felt surrounded by passionate, genuinely dedicated individuals in a way that I
had not before. It felt like a team in a way that I had not seen from ad-hoc
volunteer programs before.</p>

<p>I am hungry to find more such programs. I write this as a retrospective,
inviting you to find such environments as well. And if you’re already a
part of one, I’d love to hear about your experience.</p>
