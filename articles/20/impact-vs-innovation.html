 <h1 class="title">Impact vs Innovation &amp; Industry vs Academia</h1>
<p class="byline">December 1, 2020</p>

<article class="post">
  <p>I was recently reading Evan Martin’s blog post on his <a href="http://neugierig.org/software/blog/2020/05/ninja.html">takeaways from developing
the ninja build system</a>,
and one thing Evan mentions is his frustration at engineers that don’t look at
related work when designing systems. This reminded me of Rado Kirov’s posts on
<a href="https://rkirov.github.io/posts/incremental_computation_3/">incremental computation</a>,
where Rado argues that a lot of work in the space of incremental software is
underdeveloped because of the lack of cooperation between academic and industry
actors. Which isn’t a novel realization in general, but recently was a novel
realization to me, and has me thinking about something more general. So first a
motivating comment on that, and then we’ll specialize back to the “divide” between
academic and industry work.</p>

<p>A large thing I have been struggling with in my (so far incredibly short) career is
a frequent incongruency between what I believe is impactful and what I believe
is innovative work in an opportunity. Though “impactful” and “innovative”
are broad and personal terms, in general I mean “impactful” work to be that
which improves the quality of products broader than the work itself<span class="note"><label for="impactful" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="impactful" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">For example, reducing store waiting lines by 20% is impactful to
a business and its consumers</span>, and “innovative” work to be that which is
novel in its domain<span class="note"><label for="innovative" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="innovative" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">For example, the derivation of a
theorem.</span>. Now, I certainly don’t mean to claim there is no overlap in
impactful and innovative opportunities, or even that some overlap is uncommon,
but I do argue that opportunities with a large degree of impact and innovation
in the steady state<span class="note"><label for="steady" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="steady" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">because certainly, anything can one day
be made into an innovation or induce a great impact!</span> are not all that
common.</p>

<p>Now back to the note we started this discussion with – I think the clearest
place where this divide comes up is in this distinction between industry work
(impact by way of application) and academic work (innovation by way of theory).</p>

<p>Even though theory and application are complementary - theory inspires
application, inspires new theory, etc. - I believe that popular culture has
separated these two ideas by a thin bridge. This is evident even in the divide
we understand between theory and application!</p>

<p>Of course, this divide is very purposeful. You can’t do everything at once, and
we know that the $\text{scientist}\leftrightarrow\text{engineer}$ model works well;
it’s been alive for a very long time. The problem comes when people working on
applications lack knowledge of theory (and do not seek to learn it!), or vice
versa. Then, what
is novel to an individual is not necessarily novel in general, and time is wasted approaching
a problem from an industrial direction when theory has been developed for a
version of the problem. Or vice versa.<span class="note"><label for="related" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="related" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">A related problem
is effective knowledge sharing between domains and how to fill “valleys” in the N-dimensional landscape of
popular knowledge.</span></p>

<p>Here’s an example: my experience contributing to teams working on industrial
programming languages, I have noticed that relatively few people working in this
space in have background knowledge in programming language theory (even
self-taught!). Generally this is not an issue, but sometimes a problem comes up
that the team has not experienced before, and spends a lot of time “figuring
out”, but the problem in general is well-known and solved.</p>

<p>This is a hard problem – the biggest
challenge is that you don’t know what you don’t know, and the first step is even
learning enough to realize what you don’t know. A final example: recently I got
into abstract rewriting systems, but for a while I didn’t even realize the
problems I was trying to solve were well-known in the theory of rewrite systems
until about a month in! Obviously, after that, things got a lot easier.</p>

<p>All right, so maybe now you’re saying, “this is an ok observation, but so what?
What can we do about it?” Well, I suggest the following personal steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Inspire the relationship between formal methods and their applications during
education - concentrations like “Applied Mathematics” deserve a fair share of
theory, and “Theoretical Algorithms” deserve a fair share of applications, at
least enough so that individuals new to a field have enough of an
understanding of the larger ecosystem to know what they don’t know, what is
useful, and what isn’t.</li>
  <li>Seek out answers to ideas that are novel to you - while they may be novel to
you, they are likely not novel in general. Instead of reinventing the wheel,
first research to discover if the problem has already been solved. As
mentioned, figuring out how to discover whether the problem has been solved
may not be trivial, and so some prerequisite knowledge of the domain is
required (perhaps via (1)).</li>
  <li>When developing novel solutions, start from formal models.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s either that, or get very knowledgeable about everything. I’m not certain
which is more realistic, but I have a suspicion. And as always, if you have thoughts,
I <a href="mailto:ayaz.hafiz.1@gmail.com">would love to hear from you</a>!</p>
