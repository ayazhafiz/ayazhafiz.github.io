 <h1 class="title">The Commodification of Masculinity in Hip-Hop</h1>
<p class="byline">January 20, 2021</p>

<article class="post">
  <p>In this cc, my goal is to impress upon you the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemonic_masculinity#Hybrid_masculinity">hybrid masculinities</a>
in modern hip-hop as a commercial tool, attracting audiences but not
representing them in a meaningful way. I claim that the use of masculinities as
artistic motifs creates greater and more intersectional
inequalities between the hip-hop elite and their non-normative
audiences.</p>

<p>A quick note – this is not meant to be an instance of “cancel culture” or
anything like that. I just think that an account of this phenomenon is quite
interesting. On the other hand, this is a rather opinionated argument. If you
don’t agree with me, that’s cool!</p>

<h2 id="sexuality-as-a-musical-riff">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#sexuality-as-a-musical-riff"></a>Sexuality as a Musical Riff</h2>

<p>Today’s male hip-hop artists sing not only about their conquests and
infatuations with women, but also those with men, both women and men, and
sometimes neither women nor men. The most visible example lies with Frank
Ocean, whose 2012 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Orange">channel ORANGE</a>
is considered to be Frank’s first public expression of his bisexuality. The day he released
the album, Frank posted a <a href="https://frankocean.tumblr.com/image/26473798723">note on Tumblr</a>,
sharing that his first love was with a man.</p>

<p>The same day, Tyler the Creator tweeted out two replies to Ocean’s announcements<span class="note"><label for="Tyler-tweets" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="Tyler-tweets" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Looks like the tweets have been removed from Twitter,
but <a href="https://www.vibe.com/2012/07/frank-ocean-comes-out-bisexual-tyler-the-creator-reacts">records of them</a>
are still around. I’ve censored some parts I’m not interested in presenting on
this blog.</span>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fucking Finally Sus Boy @frank_ocean Hahahaha, You Still Aint Got No Bitches Hahaha … Dawg</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My Big Brother Finally Fucking Did That. Proud Of [Ocean] Cause I Know That Shit Is Difficult Or Whatever. Anyway. Im A Toilet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember that Tyler and Frank are in the same collective (Odd Future), and by
all accounts good friends. But at least to Tyler, Frank’s account of his
sexuality is as much of a joke as Tyler’s assertion that he is “a toilet”.</p>

<p>While these are just Tyler’s comments, I claim that the hip-hop artists in
general are not interested in dialogue about sexual diversity outside of
whatever they write in their songs. Even Frank Ocean now rejects
“the label as a queer artist, or even as bisexual,” claiming, he is “in
this business to be creative”. Theomatic states that the role of diverse
masculinities in hip-hop is artistic and power-building for rappers, conceding
that empowerment of sexually diverse masculinities in general would require much
larger work outside the hip-hop scene.<span class="note"><label for="ocean-theomatic-statements" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="ocean-theomatic-statements" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><a href="http://www.garfieldmessenger.org/4123/articles/features/masculinity-in-hip-hop-taking-the-mask-off">Source</a></span></p>

<p>Though expressions of diverse sexual experiences are novel in hip-hop, there is no
indication they are meant to break down normative discrimination of sexuality
diversity or empower LGBTQ+ communities. I mean, even Frank Ocean says that
he’s really not singing about this for any purpose other than that of his art.
And though there is nothing wrong with that sentiment, Ocean’s individual choice
manifests itself much more widely in the artistic realm as a prescription for
the use of marginalized masculinities as an aesthetic to attract marginalized
communities. This tactic grows an artist’s audience, enriches their personal
wealth, and empowers their actions, while not really giving anything back to
their audience other than a shallow sense of solidarity.
It’s like a very subtle, almost imperceptible kind of queerbaiting.</p>

<p>Similar behavior <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0891243213503901">was studied</a>
by Tristan Bridges, who saw straight men construct hybrid masculinities in an
effort to appeal to marginalized groups but ultimately produced further
inequalities between dominant and divergent masculinities. And even though Frank
Ocean and others in the hip-hop scene may not be straight, the intention and
consequences of their actions are no different.</p>

<h2 id="sometime-you-can-have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#sometime-you-can-have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too"></a>Sometime you can have your cake and eat it too</h2>

<p>Aside expressions of sexual diversity, some displays seeming to empower diverse
masculinities in hip-hop are structured in a
way as to be contradictory and even reinforce the dominance of hegemonic
masculine norms. We’ll get to what this looks like in a second; first, some
history.</p>

<p>I claim that the
nature of this juxtaposition dates back to early hip-hop, when artists developed
a simultaneous mandate to display an “authentic individual” and to display
hypermasculinity reflecting Black Power movements. This <a href="https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/SCM/article/view/8514">was studied</a>
by Megan Morris, who argues
the former attribute bound hip-hop culture to the ideals of black communities,
while the latter attribute sought to rebuff white hegemony over black
populations and enrich the influence of black masculinities in popular culture.</p>

<p>Modern rappers have inherited the mold of this
mandate; in <a href="https://genius.com/Tyler-the-creator-yonkers-lyrics">Yonkers</a>, Tyler questions whether his father would
have cared for him and speaks about working with his therapist, but not without
also admonishing “Jesus” for opening up about his problems and threatening
B.o.B. while calling him a “faggot”. In <a href="https://genius.com/Drake-finesse-lyrics">Finesse</a>,
Drake speaks to his insecurity of not always being by the side of the person he loves and his
inexperience with romantic commitment, but also mentions flying to New York to
attend Fashion Week on a whim.</p>

<p>In their <a href="https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/985160/1/Dei-Sharpe_MA_S2019.pdf">2019 thesis</a>,
Jamilah Dei-Sharpe coined expressions of vulnerability as instances of a
“Intimate Masculinity” prevalent in modern hip-hop. And while both Tyler and
Drake display intimate masculinities, they predicate their depictions on
aggressive assertions of normative masculinity like violence, homophobia, and wealth.
This severely diminishes the value of intimate masculinities on their own, and only
reinforces the dominance of heteronormative masculinities in the hip-hop arena.
Tyler’s words on the second verse of Yonkers are the most striking –
he implies that displays of male
vulnerability are either accompanied by admonishing the vulnerabilities of other
men or else are hidden from the surface of masculinity entirely. Neither of
these representations differ from the “hardened and strong” masculinity in their
representation of male vulnerability.</p>

<p>All this is culminates in the perception that intimate masculinities are
untenable and invaluable without accompaniment by traits of normative
masculinities. Of course, this serves only to
marginalize highly intersectional masculinities who are far from the hegemony
and being increasingly swindled by faux-authentic songs.</p>

<p>In the end, Tyler and Drake have had their cake, and eaten it too.</p>

<h2 id="will-you-leave-me-behind">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#will-you-leave-me-behind"></a>Will you leave me behind?</h2>

<p>The final point I want to make is that the growth of power by hip-hop artists
often collects on that which has been hidden behind barriers
constructed by white, heteronormative populations. But rather than reclaiming
this power and redistributing it to larger communities, 
these artists stay near the hegemonic status-quo.</p>

<p>This too has been seen before. The most relevant instance dates back early days
of hip-hop, when black and Chicano rappers <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23884882?seq=1">rejected traits</a> of
white hegemony only insofar as destruction of these traits awarded them power in
communities and refuted their individual subjugation under white hegemony; that
is, these rappers continued to observe other traits of white-normative
masculinities so as to hold power over their communities.</p>

<p>Today, the construction of power by hip-hop elite has generated an
increasingly-complex landscape of inequalities between masculinities; the hybrid
masculinities presented by dominant artists differs vastly from the marginalized,
intersectional masculinities they claim to represent, and it remains
unconditional that these hybrid masculinities are invaluable unless represented
at the top of hip-hop cultural hierarchy.</p>
