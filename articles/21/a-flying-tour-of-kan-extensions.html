  <p>There are all kinds of questions mathematicians (and computer scientists,
and programmers, and hobbyists) are interested in asking about relationships
between <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory">categories</a>. Functors
tell us how to embed one category in another, natural transformations
tell us how to get from one functor-defined embedding to another, and on we
climb to n-transformations. Adjunctions provide us a notion of weak equivalence<span class="note"><label for="weak-equivalence" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="weak-equivalence" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">That is, up
to natural transformations $1_\C\Ra GF$, $FG\Ra1_\D$ which may not be equivalences, but &quot;invertible&quot; in the sense of
the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/triangle+identities">triangle/zig-zag identities</a>.</span> between
categories, and are pervasive as solutions to certain optimization problems<span class="note"><label for="adjoint-optimization" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="adjoint-optimization" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">For instance, there are a tremendous amount of
$\text{Free}\dashv\text{Forgetful}$ adjunctions giving the &quot;best lift&quot; of a simpler object; a canonical example is the
free functor $F\co \Set\to\Set_*$ introducing a freely adjoined pointed element to a set,
and the forgetful functor $U\co \Set_*\to\Set$ that disregards
pointedness. This adjunction induces the <code>Maybe</code> monad, familiar to programmers.</span>.
Limits are a &quot;best approximation&quot; of a certain shape by a certain object &quot;from
the right&quot;, and colimits are so &quot;from the left&quot;<span class="note"><label for="limit-best-approximation" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="limit-best-approximation" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Impressing the idea that adjunctions are weak equivalences, for an indexing category $\J$,
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1090545">limits are a right adjoint to diagram functors</a> $\C\to\C^\J$, and colimits are
a left adjoint.</span>.
Monads give us a notion of closure operations on a category, and inform us of
what information an adjunction preserves. <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lawvere+theory">Lawvere theories</a>
are an equivalent mechanism for describing the algebras encoded by a monad.</p>
<p>Another question we may be interested in asking is, what does an extension of a
functor <span>​<script type="math/tex">F\co \C\to\E</script></span> along a functor $K\co \C\to\D$ look like? And when
no extension exists, how can we best approximate one in a reasonable way? In
this cc, I will attempt to outline the answers to these questions and
demonstrate some interesting applications, from what I hope is a relatively
accessible view. In an effort to cover a lot of material in a
short-ish post, we will sometimes gloss over the details of deep ideas. To recover their truth, check the resources at the bottom of
this cc; in particular, most of our tour is adapted from Chapter 6 of <a href="https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context/">Reihl</a>.
I am not a mathematician, but I am enthusiastic about this, and am writing this
for others who feel a similar way.</p>
<h2 id="a-definition-and-an-intuition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-definition-and-an-intuition" aria-hidden="true"></a>A definition and an intuition</h2>
<p>Suppose you have arrows $f\co X\to Z$, $i\co X\to Y$. We say that
$h\co Y\to Z$ is an extension of $f$ along $i$ if $f = h\circ i$.</p>
<p>Now, there is no reason that any arbitrary extension should exist in general. But suppose we
are dealing with extensions of functors. In this case, we may be satisfied with
an approximation of an extension, where our arrow $h$ is endowed
with a natural transformation $f\Ra h\circ i$ or $h\circ i\Ra f$
that is not necessarily yield an equivalence (or worse yet, equality).</p>
<p>It was the interest of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kan">Kan</a> to study
such approximations<span class="note"><label for="kan-extensions-why" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="kan-extensions-why" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">As far as I can tell, Kan
was looking to generalize the construction of certain adjoints for use in
homotopy theory. We will discuss one application in this vein later on.</span>. Kan clearly
embraced the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nPOV">categorical point of view</a>,
for he endowed the extensions of his namesake with a certain universal property
as well.</p>
<p>$\Def$ A <strong>left Kan extension</strong> of a functor $F\co\C\to\E$ along
$K\colon \mathsf C\to\mathsf D$ consists of a functor $\Lan_K F\co \D\to\E$ and
a unit natural transformation $\eta\colon F\Ra\Lan_K F\circ K$<label for='left-kan' class='margin-toggle'>⊕</label><input type='checkbox' id='left-kan' class='margin-toggle'/><span class='marginnote'><img class='fullwidth' src='/assets/img/kan-ext/left-kan.png'/><br></span>
such that for
any other extension pair $(G\co \D\to\E, \gamma\co F\Ra G\circ K)$, there is a
unique $\mu\co \Lan_K F\Ra G$
yielding the factorization $\gamma = \mu K \circ \eta$. This can be visualized
by the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pasting+diagram">pasting
diagram</a><span class="note"><label for="reading-pasting-diagram" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="reading-pasting-diagram" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The way to read the right-hand diagram is as follows.
First, the natural transformation $\eta$ (equivalently, a 2-morphism between morphisms of categories)
takes the arrow $F$ to the composite $\Lan_K F\circ K$. Then, the 2-morphism $\mu K$ takes $\Lan_K F\circ K$
to $G\circ K$. Importantly, $\mu K$ is a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/whiskering">whiskering</a> that yields a 2-morphism.</span></p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/left-kan-univ.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's left is what's on the right, and indeed there is a dual notion of a
<strong>right Kan extension</strong>, consisting of a functor $\Ran_K F\co \D\to\E$ and counit natural
transformation $\eps\co \Ran_K F\circ K\Ra F$<label for='right-kan' class='margin-toggle'>⊕</label><input type='checkbox' id='right-kan' class='margin-toggle'/><span class='marginnote'><img class='fullwidth' src='/assets/img/kan-ext/right-kan.png'/><br></span>
such that for any other extension pair $(G\co \D\to\E, \delta\co G\circ K\Ra
F)$, there is a unique $\mu\co G\Ra \Lan_K F$ yielding the factorization $\delta
= \eps\circ\mu K$.</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/right-kan-univ.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you may imagine, the universal property of the Kan extension is a very strong
tool for use in constructions (like most universal properties are)<span class="note"><label for="kan-univ-cat" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="kan-univ-cat" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">It may be instructive to describe what category defines the universal property of Kan
extensions. Furthermore, the idea that both (co)limits and Kan extensions are a &quot;best approximation&quot;
of a particular shape suggests there is a tight relationship between them; how could
a (co)limit be represented as a Kan extension? Both of these are <a href="#extension-problems">extension problems</a>.</span>. Indeed, we
will see that the guarantee of these unique arrows drive the way in verification
of some interesting propositions and applications.</p>
<h3 id="kan-extensions-as-adjoints" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kan-extensions-as-adjoints" aria-hidden="true"></a>Kan Extensions as Adjoints</h3>
<p>To whet our appetite, let's see how Kan extensions mesh nicely with another
powerful concept in category theory - adjoints. Indeed, the universal property
of Kan extensions admits a certain class of adjunctions.
Fixing the &quot;extension along&quot; functor $K\co \C\to\D$, we can see that when all
functors $F\co \C\to\E$ have a left and right Kan extension along $K$, these data
assemble into parallel functors $\Lan_K, \Ran_K\co \E^\C\rightrightarrows\E^\D$
that take a functor $\C\to\E$ to its left or right Kan extension $\D\to\E$ along $K$.</p>
<p>$\Thm$ When they exist, $\Lan_K$ and $\Ran_K$ define left and right
adjoints to the pre-composition functor $K^*\co \E^\D\to\E^\C$.<label for='lan-k-ran-adj' class='margin-toggle'>⊕</label><input type='checkbox' id='lan-k-ran-adj' class='margin-toggle'/><span class='marginnote'><img class='fullwidth' src='/assets/img/kan-ext/lan-k-ran-adj.png'/><br></span></p>
<p>$\Pf$ The universal property of the left Kan extension of $F$ along $K$ demands
that for any $G\co\D\to\E$, a natural transformation $F\Ra GK$ corresponds
exactly to a natural transformation $\Lan_K F \Ra G$. This correspondence
assembles into a natural isomorphism $\E^\D\left(Lan_K F, G\right)\cong
\E^\C\left(F, GK\right)$, which is exactly the family of bijections defining
the adjunction $\Lan_K\dashv K^*$. That this family of bijections is natural in $F$ and $G$
is relatively straightforward to check; the details are given in Riehl 6.1.5.
The argument for $K^*\dashv\Ran_K$ is similar. $\square$</p>
<h3 id="when-extensions-are-not-kan-extensions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#when-extensions-are-not-kan-extensions" aria-hidden="true"></a>When Extensions are not Kan Extensions</h3>
<p>On the other hand, the
demand of such a universal property may suggest that Kan extensions are
relatively hard to come by, not unlike (co)limits in certain categories. It
turns out that the presence of this universal property actually fails to
lift extensions to Kan extensions in general.</p>
<p>For example, consider the terminal
category $\require{unicode}\1$ consisting of a single object,
the discrete category $\bar{\2}$ with two objects, the inclusion
functor $\iota\co \1\hookrightarrow\bar\2$, and the constant endofunctor $z\co
\bar\2\to\bar\2$ into $0$. By our construction, it
is the case that $\iota = z\circ\iota$, so $z$ is a proper extension of
$\iota$ along $\iota$; perhaps we would expect that the pair $(z, 1_\iota\co
\iota\Ra z\circ\iota)$ yields a left or right Kan extension. But it does
neither; consider the pair $(1_\bar{\2}, 1_\iota\co \iota \Ra 1_\bar{\2}\circ
\iota)$. If $z$ is a left Kan extension, we need a natural transformation $z\Ra
1_\bar{\2}$, which demands an arrow $0 = z1 \to 1_\bar{\2}1 = 1\in\text{mor}\left(\bar\2\right)$, but
no such arrow exists.</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/ext-no-kan-ext.png' width='70%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>It would be nice to know how to build up certain Kan extensions, just as we
know how to build up (co)limits in certain categories<span class="note"><label for="certain-colimits" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="certain-colimits" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">For example, we know products and coproducts in $\Set$,
which are limits and colimits under a diagram indexed by a discrete category,
are exactly the type- and set-theoretic notions of products and disjoint unions.</span>.
Category theory never fails to reflect on itself, not the least with great coherence - we will see that certain
Kan extensions can be built from certain (co)limits.</p>
<h2 id="building-kan-extensions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#building-kan-extensions" aria-hidden="true"></a>Building Kan Extensions</h2>
<p>We have already discussed the notion that Kan extensions are a kind-of
approximation for a true extension, modulo a natural transformation<span class="note"><label for="intuition" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="intuition" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The following intuition for the construction of Kan extensions comes from Riehl.</span>.
In particular, a left Kan extension of $F\co \C\to\E$ along $K\co \C\to\D$ is the &quot;best&quot; approximation of
an extension of $F$ along $K$ &quot;from the left&quot;, which is to say up to a natural
transformation $\eta\co F\Ra\Lan_KF\circ K$ initial among all natural
transformations $F\Ra GK$ via an arrow $\Lan_KF\Ra G$ &quot;from the left&quot;. Taking
this idea of &quot;approximating from the left&quot; to
heart, to define the action of $\Lan_KF$ on an object $d$ we may want to consider the
action of $F$ on objects in $\C$ that &quot;approximate&quot; $d$. In the present context,
there are two reasonable ways to determine what objects &quot;approximate&quot; $d$. One
is to choose those objects $c\in\C$ such that $Kc\cong d$. Another is to choose
objects $c\in\C$ whose image under $K$ can &quot;get to&quot; $d$, which is to say there
is an arrow $Kc\to d$. Indeed, considering the idea of approximation most
universally, the latter feels more appropriate. Such &quot;approximating&quot; arrows
$Kc\to d$ are exactly the objects of the
comma category $K\downarrow d$, which has a canonical projection functor
$\Pi^d\co K\downarrow d\to\C$ that takes an arrow $Kc\to d$ defining an &quot;approximation of $d$ from the left&quot; to the
&quot;approximating object&quot; $c$. We can then map each such
object via $F$, defining a diagram $K\downarrow d\xrightarrow{\Pi^d}\C\xrightarrow{F}\E$
whose image seemingly provides a number of approximations for the image of $d$
&quot;from the left&quot;. How do we collapse these approximations into a single object? Take a colimit!</p>
<p>$\Thm$ Consider $F\co \C\to\E$ and $K\co \C\to\D$. If $\forall d\in\D$ the
colimit</p>
<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\text{colim}(K\downarrow d\xrightarrow{\Pi^d}\C\xrightarrow{F}\E) =: \Lan_K F(d)
</script></div>
<p>of the diagram $F\Pi^d$ exists, these data assemble into a functor
$\Lan_K F\co \D\to\E$, and the colimit cones embed the unit $\eta\co F\Ra\Lan_K F\circ K$,
such that $\Lan_K F, \eta$ define the left Kan extension of $F$ along $K$.</p>
<p>Dually, if $\forall d\in\D$ the limit</p>
<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\text{lim}(d\downarrow K\xrightarrow{\Pi_d}\C\xrightarrow{F}\E) =: \Ran_K F(d)
</script></div>
<p>of the diagram $F\Pi_d$ exists, these data assemble into a functor
$\Ran_K F\co \D\to\E$, and the limit cones embed the counit $\eps\co \Ran_K F\circ K\Ra F$,
such that $\Ran_K F, \eps$ define the right Kan extension of $F$ along $K$.</p>
<p>$\text{Sketch}.$ We will describe exactly what $\Lan_KF\co \D\to\E$ and the unit $\eta\co F\Ra\Lan_KF\circ K$ of
the left Kan extension look like. First of all, let us denote the cocone of each colimit $\Lan_KF(d)$ as
$\lam^d\co F\Pi^d\Ra\Lan_KF(d)$. Now, taking a morphism $g\co d\to d'\in \D$, we
can define a cocone $\bar\lam^{d'}\co F\Pi^d\Ra\Lan_KF(d')$ whose components are
given by $\bar\lam^{d'}_{f\co Kc\to d} := \lam^{d'}_{gf\co Kc\to d'}$. By the
universal property of the colimit $\Lan_KF(d)$, this induces a unique
arrow $\Lan_KF(g)\co \Lan_KF(d)\to\Lan_KF(d')$ factoring $\bar\lam^{d'}$ through
$\lam^d$.</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/kan-formula-cone-arrow.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Functoriality of $\Lan_KF$ follows from the uniqueness of this arrow<span class="note"><label for="uniqueness-functoriality" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="uniqueness-functoriality" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">If you have not verified a
&quot;functoriality-by-uniqueness&quot; proof before, here is a good chance to do so.</span>.
We recover the unit $\eta\co F\Ra\Lan_KF\circ K$ by defining</p>
<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\eta_c := \lam_{1_{Kc}\co Kc\to Kc}^{Kc}\co Fc\to\Lan_KF(Kc)\qquad\forall c\in\C

<p>The naturality of $\eta$ is straightforward to verify using the action of $\Lan_KF$ on
morphisms, while proof of the universal property of the left Kan extension is
given by Riehl 6.2.1. $\diamond$</p>
<h3 id="an-example%3A-continuous-functions-in-the-reals" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#an-example%3A-continuous-functions-in-the-reals" aria-hidden="true"></a>An example: Continuous functions in the reals</h3>
<p>$\text{Problem.}$ Suppose we are given some subset $\S$ of the reals<span class="note"><label for="real-subsets" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="real-subsets" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Good
options are $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, or $\R$ itself.</span>.
When does a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function">monotonic function</a>
$f\co (\S, \le)\to(\R, \le)$ have both a left and right Kan extension along the
inclusion $\iota\co \S\hookrightarrow\R$, and when are these extensions equal?</p>
<p>$\text{Solution.}$ Applying the colimit formula for left Kan extensions, we see that $\Lan_\iota f\co \R\to\R$
exists when $\forall r\in\R$ the diagram $\iota\downarrow r\xrightarrow{\Pi^r}\S\xrightarrow{f}\R$
admits a colimit. This diagram is indexed by arrows $\iota(n\in\S)\to r$, and
the image of each such arrow is $f(n)\in\R$; that is to say, if the colimit of this
diagram exists, it is the supremum<span class="note"><label for="supremum" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="supremum" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">All colimits in a poset category are suprema
of bounded subsets.</span> of $\left\{f(n) ~|~ n\le r\right\}$. Indeed this
colimit exists, for $\left\{f(n) ~|~ n\le r\right\}$ is bounded above in $\R$,
and all non-empty sets bounded above in $\R$ <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/m125b/ch2.pdf">have a supremum</a>.
Denoting the colimit cone at $r$ $\lam^r\co (\iota\downarrow r\xrightarrow{\Pi^r}\S\xrightarrow{f}\R)\Ra \sup\left\{f(n)~|~ n\le r\right\}$,
we have that the unit $\eta\co f\Ra \Lan_\iota f\circ \iota$ of the left Kan
extension is given by the components $\eta_n = \lambda_{1_{\iota n}}^{\iota n}$,
which in particular demands the relation $f(n)\le \Lan_\iota f(n)$, hence it must be that
$f(n)\le\sup\left\{f(q) ~|~ q\le n\right\}$ $\forall
n\in\S$. But $f$ is monotonic, so this strictly implies $f(n)=\sup\left\{f(q) ~|~ q\le n\right\}$.
That is to say, $f$ admits a left Kan extension along $\S\hookrightarrow\R$
when $f$ is continuous on the left.</p>
<p>Applying the dual limit formula for right Kan extensions, we find that a right
Kan extension of $f$ along $\S\hookrightarrow\R$ demands
$f(n)=\inf\left\{f(q) ~|~ q\ge n\right\}$ $\forall n\in\S$, which is to
say that $f$ is continuous on the right.</p>
<p>Putting this together, $\Lan_{\iota}f = \Ran_{\iota}f$ exactly when $f$ is
continuous.<span class="note"><label for="continuous-function" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="continuous-function" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://math.vanderbilt.edu/bohmanar/">Anna Marie Bohmann</a> says this is
probably a terrible way to first introduce the notion of continuous functions.
But I say, this is exactly the viewpoint the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/">nLab</a>
would want us to embrace. I'll leave you to decide whether a graduate-level
course on category theory should be part of a high school math curriculum.</span> $\square$</p>
<p>These demands make intuitive sense as well. A left Kan extension of $f$ along
the inclusion into $\R$ is in some sense the &quot;best approximation&quot; of $f$ in $\R$ &quot;from the left&quot;,
so it seems natural that $f$ should be continuous at least on the left for this
to make any sense.</p>
<h2 id="absolute-kan-extensions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#absolute-kan-extensions" aria-hidden="true"></a>Absolute Kan Extensions</h2>
<p>Before we get to more fun applications, we have to introduce some auxiliary
definitions relating to Kan extensions. The first is analogous the preservation
of (co)limits by certain functors.</p>
<p>$\Def$ A functor $L\co \E\to\J$ <strong>preserves</strong> left Kan extensions if, for all
left Kan extensions $(\Lan_K F, \eta)$ of $F\co \C\to\E$ along $K\co \C\to\D$,
$(L\Lan_K F, L\eta)$ is a left Kan extension of $LF$ along $K$.</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/preserve-kan-ext.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>The notion of preservation for right Kan extensions is similar.</p>
<p>A natural to question to ask is whether adjoints preserve Kan extensions, like
they preserve (co)limits. Indeed</p>
<p>$\Thm$ Left adjoints preserve left Kan extensions. Dually, right adjoints
preserve right Kan extensions.</p>
<p>$\text{Sketch}.$ Hint: Use the natural isomorphism defining an adjunction and the universal
property of Kan extensions to construct a chain of natural isomorphisms
demonstrating that $(L\Lan_K F, L\eta)$ is a left Kan extension of $LF$ along $K$.
For details, or a visual proof via pasting diagrams, see Riehl 6.3.2. $\diamond$</p>
<p>There is a certain class of Kan extensions that turn out to be surprisingly
useful, and whose definition depends on the notion of preservation.</p>
<p>$\Def$ A right Kan extension $\Ran_K F\co \D\to\E$ is <strong>pointwise</strong> if it is preserved
by representable functors $\E(e, -)$ $\forall e\in\E$.</p>
<p>The definition of a pointwise left Kan extension is dual, but the arrows of
2-morphisms are reversed rather than the arrows of 1-morphisms.
It turns out that a Kan extension is pointwise exactly when it can be computed
by the (co)limit formula given earlier (Riehl 6.3.6, 6.3.7).</p>
<p>Here is an interesting fact regarding pointwise Kan extensions.</p>
<p>$\Thm$ If $\E$ is small and admits all small copowers<span class="note"><label for="copowers" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="copowers" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Iterated coproducts of a single object</span>, all right Kan extensions with
codomain $\E$ are pointwise. Dually, if $\E$ is small and admits all small
powers, all left Kan extensions with codomain $\E$ are pointwise.</p>
<p>$\Pf$ When $\E$ admits all copowers, a functor $\E\to\Set$ is representable <a href="https://ayazhafiz.com/articles/21/representability-coproducts-reflective-subcategories#46iii-representable-functors-from-categories-with-coproducts-are-described-exactly-by-a-left-adjoint">iff
it has a left adjoint</a>.
Hence, all representable functors $\E(e,-)$ are right adjoints, and right
adjoints preserve right Kan extensions. $\square$</p>
<p>Preservation by representables may seem somewhat arbitrary, and indeed we may
want to ask if there are Kan extensions that are preserved by everything.
Certainly these are even more rare, but they do exist.</p>
<p>$\Def$ A Kan extension is <strong>absolute</strong> if it is preserved by all functors.</p>
<p>At this point, these definitions may seem well and good but unsatisfying. Where do Kan
extensions arise, and what are they good for? To answer
this, perhaps it is best to tie the knot with other concepts in Category
Theory and see how Kan extensions provide a categorical point-of-view in other
mathematics. As a first application, let us further explore the relationship
between adjunctions and Kan extensions.</p>
<h2 id="adjoints-as-kan-extensions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#adjoints-as-kan-extensions" aria-hidden="true"></a>Adjoints as Kan Extensions</h2>
<p>We have seen that Kan extensions give rise to a certain class of adjunctions
($\Lan_K\dashv K^*\dashv\Ran_K$). Do adjunctions give rise to Kan extensions?
Certainly!</p>
<p>$\Thm$ If $F\dashv G$ is an adjunction with unit $\eta$ and counit $\eps$,
$(G,\eta)$ defines a left Kan extension of the identity along $F$, and $(F,\eps)$ defines
a right Kan extension of the identity along $G$. Furthermore, both Kan
extensions are absolute.</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/adj-kan-ext.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>$\Pf$ An adjunction $F\dashv G$ gives rise to an adjunction between their
precomposition functors. Specifically in the case of precomposing functors with
codomain $\C$, there is an adjunction</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/adj-kan-ext-precomp-adj.png' width='30%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>But $\Lan_F\dashv F^*$, so $G^*\cong \Lan_F$ because adjoints are unique up to
unique isomorphism. After checking some details (Riehl 6.5.2, 4.4.6), this tell
us that the left Kan extension of $1_\mathsf{C}$ along $F$ is given by $(G, \eta)$.
To show that this Kan extension is absolute, consider another functor $L\co
\C\to\E$ and let $(H\co \D\to\E, \gamma\co L\Ra HF)$ be an extension of $L$
along $F$. We claim that this factors through the preserved left Kan extension
$(LG, L\eta)$ of $L$ along $F$ via $H\eta\circ\gamma G$. A series of pasting
diagram rewrites, given by the naturality of $\gamma$ and the zig-zag/triangle
identity of the adjunction $F\dashv G$ verifies this.</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/adj-kan-ext-absolute-verification.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>To see that this factorization is unique, suppose there is a $\mu\co LG\Ra H$
such that $\gamma = \mu F\circ L\eta$. Then by this definition, the naturality
of $\mu$, and the zig-zag/triangle identity of the adjunction $F\dashv G$,</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/adj-kan-ext-unique.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>we see that the factorization $\gamma = \mu F\circ L\eta$ is equally $\gamma =
(H\eta\circ\gamma G)F\circ L\eta$. By uniqueness, this demands $\mu =
H\eta\circ\gamma G$. $\square$</p>
<p>Naturally, adjunctions may also be recovered from Kan extensions of identities.</p>
<p>$\Thm$ If $(G, \eta\co 1_\C\Ra GF)$ is a left Kan extension of $1_\C$ along $F$ and
furthermore $F$ preserves this Kan extension, $F\dashv G$ is an adjunction with
unit $\eta$.</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/kan-ext-to-adj-fig.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>$\Pf$ If the left Kan extension $(G,\eta)$ is preserved by $F$, $(FG, F\eta\co
F\Ra FGF)$ is a left Kan extension of $F$ along itself. Taking the extension pair
$(1_\D, 1_F)$, the universal property of the left Kan extension demands a unique
$\eps\co FG\Ra 1_\D$ such that $1_F = \eps F\circ F\eta$.</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/kan-ext-to-adj-tid1.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Taking $\eps$ to be the counit of the proposed adjunction, this demonstrates one
zig-zag/triangle identity. To see the other, consider the extension pair
$(G,\eta)$ of $1_\C$ along $F$; clearly, this factors through the left Kan
extension $(G,\eta)$ (itself) via the identity. Rewriting the factorization
pasting diagram using the already-demonstrated identity $1_F = \eps F\circ F\eta$,</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/kan-ext-to-adj-tid2.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>which communicates that the $(G,\eta)$ is factored through itself by
$G\eps\circ\eta G$. By uniqueness of the universal property of the left Kan
extension, this demands $1_G = G\eps\circ\eta G$. $\square$</p>
<p>Where there is an adjunction there is a monad, so we can keep the conversation
going - when can we recover monads from Kan extensions?</p>
<h2 id="kan-extensions-as-monads" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kan-extensions-as-monads" aria-hidden="true"></a>Kan Extensions as Monads</h2>
<p>It turns out the demands to find a canonical monad from a Kan extension are
looser than those of finding an adjunction in the manner presented above. In
particular, there is no requirement of preservation.</p>
<p>$\Thm$ When the right Kan extension of $G\co \D\to\C$ along itself exists<label for='codensity-monad' class='margin-toggle'>⊕</label><input type='checkbox' id='codensity-monad' class='margin-toggle'/><span class='marginnote'><img class='fullwidth' src='/assets/img/kan-ext/kan-ext-to-monad-tvis.png'/><br></span>,

a functor is <strong>dense</strong> if its left Kan extension along itself is the identity;

colimit formula for left Kan extensions, this says that given a dense functor $F\co\mathsf{S}\to\C$
where $\mathsf{S}$ is a subcategory of $\C$, all objects in $\C$ are colimits of certain
diagrams from $\mathsf{S}$. There is much more to this topic outside the scope of this

factorization of $(1_\C, 1_G)$ through $(T,\eps)$, and $\mu\co T^2\Ra T$ as the
unique factorization of $(T^2, \eps\circ T\eps)$ through $(T,\eps)$, the triple
$(T, \eta, \mu)$ defines a monad on $C$.</p>

Consider the extension pair $(T^3, \eps\circ T\eps\circ T^2\eps\co T^3G\Ra G)$.

<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/kan-ext-to-monad-mult-com-proof.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>we see that both $\mu\circ\mu T$ (above left) and $\mu\circ T\mu$ (above right)
factor $\eps\circ T\eps\circ T^2\eps$ through the right Kan extension. Uniqueness
of this factorization demands $\mu\circ\mu T = \mu\circ T\mu$.</p>

consider the extension pair $(T,\eps)$, which factors uniquely through itself

ways,</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/kan-ext-to-monad-id-com-proof.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>we see that both $\mu\circ\eta T$ (above left) and $\mu\circ T\eta$ (above right)
factor $\eps$ through itself. Again, uniqueness of this factorization demands $\mu\circ\eta T = \mu\circ T\eta$,
and furthermore both composites must also equal $1_T$. $\square$</p>
<p>Not only are codensity monads canonical, they are canonically canonical.</p>
<p>$\Thm$ If $G$ admits a left adjoint $F$, then $G$ admits a codensity monad, and
furthermore the codensity monad of $G$ is the canonical monad $(GF, \eta,
G\epsilon F)$ induced by $F\dashv G$ where $\eta$, $\epsilon$ are the unit and
counit of the adjunction, respectively.</p>
<p>$\Pf$ When $F\dashv G$, $(F, \eta)$ is a right Kan extension of $1_\D$ along $G$.
Right adjoints preserve right Kan extensions, so $(GF, G\eta)$ is a right Kan
extension of $G$ along itself, which is to say the codensity monad of $G$ is
given by $GF$. This is exactly the endofunctor of the canonical monad induced by
$F\dashv G$. $G\eps \circ \eta G = 1_G$ by one triangle identity, so $\eta$ is
the multiplication of the condensity monad. By the naturality of $G\eps$, $G\eps\circ GFG\eps = G\eps\circ
G\eps FG$<label for='naturality-Ge' class='margin-toggle'>⊕</label><input type='checkbox' id='naturality-Ge' class='margin-toggle'/><span class='marginnote'><img class='fullwidth' src='/assets/img/kan-ext/kan-ext-monad-canonical-nat.png'/><br></span>, so $G\eps F$ is the
multiplication of the codensity monad. $\square$</p>
<h2 id="an-application-in-homotopy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#an-application-in-homotopy" aria-hidden="true"></a>An Application in Homotopy</h2>
<p>To finish off this tour, let's see a role Kan extensions play in the field they
first arose from. To start, we need to define a weak notion of isomorphism.</p>
<p>$\Def$ A class of morphisms $M$ in a category $\C$ satisfies the <strong>2-of-6 property</strong> if for any
composable triple $f,g,h\in \text{mor}(\C)$, $hg, gf\in M\implies f,g,h,hgf\in M$.</p>
<p>$\Def$ For a category $\C$, a class of <strong>weak equivalences</strong> is a class of morphisms $W\subseteq
\text{mor}(\C)$ containing all the identities and satisfying the 2-of-6
property.</p>
<p>It is straightforward to show that all isomorphisms are weak equivalences. Now,
here's where the homotopy comes in.</p>
<p>$\Def$ A category equipped with a class of weak equivalences is a <strong>homotopical
category</strong>.</p>
<p>$\Def$ A functor is <strong>homotopical</strong> if it is between homotopical categories, and
it preserves weak equivalences.</p>
<p>It is similarly straightforward to show that an endofunctor $F$ on a
homotopical category $\C$ is a homotopical functor if it is equipped with a natural
weak equivalence<span class="note"><label for="nat-weak-eq" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="nat-weak-eq" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">That is, a natural transformation whose components are all weak equivalences.</span>
to ($\require{extpfeil}\Newextarrow{\xRightarrow}{5,5}{0x21D2}F\xRightarrow{\sim}1_\C$) or from ($1_\C\xRightarrow{\sim}F$)
the identity.</p>
<p>Now suppose that $\C$ is a homotopical category, and there is some functor
$F\co \C\to\D$ taking the weak equivalences to isomorphisms. It turns out that
such functors arise frequently in homotopy, and so it may be natural to ask what
it means to have an initial or final object in the category of such functors.
The final object is not that interesting<span class="note"><label for="final-localization" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="final-localization" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">what is
it?</span>, but the universal property of the initial object certainly is.</p>
<p>$\Def$ For any homotopical category $\C$, there is a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy+category"><strong>homotopy category</strong></a>
$\HoC$ and a universal <strong>localization functor</strong> $Q_\C\co \C\to\HoC$ that is initial in the category of functors that takes weak
equivalences in $\C$ to isomorphisms.</p>
<p>What a homotopy category looks like doesn't matter too much for us, but a good
intuition for its shape is given by the homotopical notion that many arrows can
be seen as equivalent or invertible up to homotopy. For more details, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization_of_a_category">Wikipedia</a>
has a nice construction, as does <a href="https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/GZ.pdf">Gabriel and Zisman, 67</a>.</p>
<p>Now suppose we have a homotopical functor $\C\to\D$. We may be interested in
the &quot;localization&quot; of this functor; that is, does this functor induce a
functor $\HoC\to\HoD$ between homotopy categories, and if so, what does such a
functor look like? Maybe you already see where this is going - we can phrase
these questions as extension problems.</p>
<p>$\Def$ Let $F\co \C\to\D$ be a homotopical functor. When it exists, the right
Kan extension $\dL F:=\Ran_{Q_\C}Q_\D F$ of $Q_\D F$ along $Q_\C$ defines
the <strong>total left derived functor</strong> of $F$.</p>
<p>Dually, when it exists, the left Kan extension $\dR F:=\Lan_{Q_\C}Q_\D F$
defines the <strong>total right derived functor</strong> of $F$.</p>
<figure class='fullwidth'><img src='/assets/img/kan-ext/derived-functor-vis.png' width='100%'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since total derived functors are in some sense an approximation of a homotopical
functor, it is reasonable to ask if a total derived functor observes the same
functorial properties as the functor it was derived from. More generally, we
could pose this question for any Kan extension; indeed in general there is no
reason this should be true, but <a href="https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/272266/1-s2.0-S1631073X07X01195/1-s2.0-S1631073X07001045/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEEgaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIBA8%2Bhe%2Fwolh%2BgVj1HrkBCFR1sJmKraNzbOEAdeyHJ2EAiEAr90Aq498yRp7mySYPyiSBxP9oufr%2FrzWq8%2BP6XTEMh8qvQMIwP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARADGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDD2aAC%2FjZCkdUjfmyCqRA%2FmgZRsr51e4dOSUVpJdTAEtyY1o%2BL444sxo3Go9hwMjTMcQ0QbYnzCIrttJc1eVc3khR26h8xqRjoH5aoJ%2Bt2L2%2BsaCmKo62wJzKoDzD6iAZ0NKDNdvoYYrRnXVaRr0HFhmUa2PK8kc%2BJXQOppmiG6KnGTkz9FvLNv86KLCj4GqUddyZAM3fijzR76IHei4C%2BlZZpkizlq4q6JiO3E9SC3L9%2F26ad%2FAR3qNiJ3815taTqz2oWzXg9EJtg76TU72FeP40mWH6SxD6PEbwHd6D5teDrLu%2FuqK3Xl9g%2FwaXwcb3%2BtWrRAbJcHQr39lGkykCmTd82rD01JyEHEzwUrc62R7A3Jh91O9TkgQVTbY4akYXR21IDGLGc4QCTj9M5EGgQ8Qep8yUbtsPHKJH6Hi4ga1WQkn%2BWy%2FSHOu1tDHtLZ%2FewNkXYXLAWxaVDBNfPA44rBnT3qkVBd2FDl7KyTaJ%2B0OBOtPWfkvSgJ0N5Rtc3P6Lx0ZGvc2Qkbi%2BRYdG0GOHbuFfacDy1crZ%2BSG74gqnqNcML%2BEu4QGOusBgSGJiNPa%2FOnFKeMsvEYCm0Y0lQTuRI40mM0OW%2FbLPjAZldJG0t87VZfkHQqswkd4tbMEn5g5sdobIOnCP5%2BqqWnRiWnh5ZV6rBy4gTjLKAq8NpJxcMgthpJMLzrvIdoMZkX4Q15WKLMd06xDoxQLjcERjibxyuuUR24JHERQLrPQ%2BWkjk4laFWZXFO6ihUO5XAky%2FDHCsa2QVNDLI1XrWP4siUzDOmOwFXFFusqJXi9Xt3qNoARd0ZILSwm%2FGBj0ALhlsWDoywOH%2F43qJVW3Q4uhzvUaP6Rl1OQJNaM8gy1cBFVKb5%2FYhW69Jg%3D%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20210502T165001Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=300&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYWE6KRSVG%2F20210502%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=76097881aa89c6b5cc0e732f2a55d58ee7f2a01aee3603d7a1b90b8f2064e414&amp;hash=4f750508a13b8fc69bffb7f61ac6ac9245656bc45686c7676450eb59797123ec&amp;host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&amp;pii=S1631073X07001045&amp;tid=spdf-b31a761f-213c-4eec-97a6-43b88b1d81e9&amp;sid=5f61f1133d98494bf35b0bf3724d535aa0abgxrqa&amp;type=client">Maltsiniotis</a>

<p>Uniqueness of this factorization demands $\eps\dL F\circ\dL F\eta = 1_{\dL F}$.
Verification of the zig-zag identity $\dR G\eps\circ\eta\dR G= 1_{\dR G}$
proceeds similarly. $\square$</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Describe (co)limits in terms of Kan extensions. (There are at least two ways
to do so; see Riehl 6.3.10 and 6.5.1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose your favorite functor $K\co \C\to\Set$ that admits both a left and right
adjoint. Express that functor as a precomposition functor between functor
categories<span class="note"><label for="precomposition-functor" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="precomposition-functor" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Hint: think about mapping out
of the terminal category $\1$.</span>, and compute the left and right adjoints
of $K$ using the (co)limit formulas for Kan extensions and the fact that
$\Lan_K\dashv K^*\dashv\Ran_K$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find an absolute Kan extension that is different from the Kan extensions
induced by an adjunction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State the universal property of Kan extensions precisely - that is, what is
the category in which left Kan extensions are initial, and what is the
category in which right Kan extensions are final?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuing from (4), over what diagrams are Kan extensions (co)limits?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show that the 2-of-6 property implies the <strong>2-of-3 property</strong>: If any two of $f$, $g$,
or $gf$ are weak equivalences, so is the third. Use this to complete the proofs
mentioned as &quot;straightforward&quot; in the homotopy section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(For the programmers in the room.) Well-type what it means for a functor to a
be a (left/right) Kan extension in your favorite functional language, making
sure to encode the universal property. Then, choose your favorite functor,
an extension, a Kan extension along that functor, and write a procedure to
extract the universal property of the extension given any other functor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
