 <h1 class="title">Representability, Coproducts, and Reflective Subcategories</h1>
<p class="byline">April 2, 2021</p>

<article class="post">
  <p>In this cc, I want to write up a couple problems from Emily Riehl’s text
<a href="https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context/">Category Theory in Context</a> that I’ve
found particularly interesting over the last week. In some sense they feel
“fundamental”, and while their conclusions seem to be well-known I have had
difficulty finding other proofs of these propositions from online searches.</p>

<p>The first problem is 4.6.iii in the text, which shows that representable functors
from categories with all coproducts are described exactly by their left
adjoints.</p>

<p>The second problem is 4.5.vii in the text, which has to do with the
characterization of reflective subcategories, their adjoints, the notion of an
essential image, and what it means to be a localization.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I will assume some background with category theory in the
discussion of these problems. Perhaps in the future I will try to make a
digestible introduction to category theory, but at this point I am too naive to
attempt anything like that <img class="emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" src="https://gitlab.com/ayazhafiz/emoji-img/raw/master/public/emoji/unicode/1f642.png" height="20" width="20">.</p>

<h2 id="46iii-representable-functors-from-categories-with-coproducts-are-described-exactly-by-a-left-adjoint">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#46iii-representable-functors-from-categories-with-coproducts-are-described-exactly-by-a-left-adjoint"></a>(4.6.iii) Representable functors from categories with coproducts are described exactly by a left adjoint</h2>

<p>This lemma is exciting and beautiful! In one direction the conclusion is
trivial; in the other, some construction is needed. It reminds me heavily of the
Yoneda lemma, with mathematical objects sitting at different orders of magnitude
ending up encoding the same information.</p>

<p>$\text{Lemma.}$ Suppose $C$ is a locally small category with coproducts. Show
that a functor $F\colon C\to\text{Set}$ is representable if and only if it
admits a left adjoint.</p>

<p>$\text{Proof.}$ Suppose first that $F$ admits a left adjoint $L$. Then, denoting
$\star$ to be the terminal object in $\text{Set}$<span class="note"><label for="star" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="star" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Equivalently, $\star$ is the singleton set (up to unique isomorphism, of course).</span>,
the adjunction $L\vdash F$ yields the natural isomorphism</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">
C(L\star, -)\cong \text{Set}(\star, F-)\cong F
</script></div>

<p>Where $C(L\star, -), \text{Set}(\star, F-)\colon C\to Set$ are the evident
hom-functors. Indeed, the natural isomorphism $C(L\star, -)\cong F$ stipulates
that $F$ is represented by $L\star$.</p>

<p>Conversely, suppose that $F$ is represented by an object $c\in C$. Let us define
a functor $L\colon \text{Set}\to C$ as follows. Given a set $A$, $LA :=
\coprod_{a\in A} c$, the colimit of the discrete diagram indexed by $A$ into $C$
at the constant object $c$. Indeed this definition is admissible, for $C$ admits
all coproducts.</p>

<p>For a set morphism $f\colon A\to B$, $Lf\colon \coprod_{a\in A}c\to \coprod_{b\in B}c$
is the unique morphism factoring the $A$-indexed cocone $c\Rightarrow \prod_{b\in B} c$ given by
$\left\{\iota_{fa}\colon fa\hookrightarrow LB \right\}_{a\in A}$
through $LA$. For a morphism $f: A\to B$ where $A= \left\{a_1,a_2\right\}$,
this can be visualized by the diagram</p>

<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/assets/img/cat4.5-4.6/l-morphisms.png" width="30%"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>Indeed $L$ preserves identities, for $L 1_A$ uniquely factors the colimit cone
under a particular diagram through that diagram’s colimit, and hence $L 1_A$ must be
the identity morphism on the colimit $FA$. Uniqueness of the universal
property of colimits ensures that $Lg\circ Lf = L(g\circ f)$ for appropriate
$f\colon A\to B, g\colon B\to D\in \text{Set}$ as well; $Lg\circ Lf$ and $L(g\circ f)$ both factor an $A$-indexed cone
given by $\left\{\iota_{gfa}\right\}_{a\in A}$ through $LA$, but this factorization is unique.</p>

<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/assets/img/cat4.5-4.6/lcomp-morphisms.png" width="40%"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>Thus, $L$ as defined is functorial. We are left to show $L\vdash F$. To this
end, we will define the unit $\eta\colon 1_{\text{Set}}\Rightarrow FL$ and show
$\eta$ observes a certain universal property yielding an isomorphism ${\eta_d}^{*}\circ F\colon C(LA, d)\cong \text{Set}(A, Fd)$
natural in $d\in C$<span class="note"><label for="naturalind" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="naturalind" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">In fact, naturality in $d$ is
immediate because $\eta$ is a natural transformation.</span>. For a set $A$, the
arrow $\eta_A\colon A\to FLA$ is equivalently represented by an arrow $A\to
C(c, \coprod_{a\in A} c)$. This characterization forces the action of $\eta_A$
to be given by $\eta_A(a\in A) = \iota_a\colon c\hookrightarrow \coprod_{a\in A} c$.
Furthermore, we claim $\eta_A$ is an isomorphism. Clearly, $\eta_A$ is
injective. To see that this map is surjective, observe that any morphism $f\colon c\to \coprod_{a\in A}$
constitutes a cocone under an particular diagram with coproduct $\coprod_{a\in A}$.
This cocone has nadir $\coprod_{a\in A}$ and must factor uniquely through the
colimit cone given by $\coprod_{a\in A}$; this factorization must be given by
the identity on the colimit, and in particular we have that $f=1_{\coprod_{a\in A}}\circ i_{a’}=i_{a’}$ for some
$a’\in A$. Reiterated, $f$ must be a leg of the colimit cone given by $\coprod_{a\in A}$, given exactly by an element
of $A$.</p>

<p>Having defined $\eta$ and shown it is an natural isomorphism, showing the
composite</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">
C(LA, d)\xrightarrow{F} \text{Set}(FLA, Fd)\xrightarrow{ {\eta_A}^*}\text{Set}(A, Fd)
</script></div>

<p>is an isomorphism for $A\in \text{Set}$, $d\in C$ boils down to showing
that the arrow $F: C(LA, d)\to \text{Set}(FLA, Fd)$ is an isomorphism. Applying
the representability of $F$ and the behavior of $L$, we see that this arrow is
valued equivalently as</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">
C(\coprod_{a\in A} c, d)\xrightarrow{C(c, -)} \text{Set}(C(c, \coprod_{a\in A} c), C(c, d))
</script></div>

<p>For convenience, let us denote $\bar{A}\colon A\to C$ to be the diagram with colimit $\coprod_{a\in A} c$.
Now, consider an arrow in the hom-set $\text{Set}(C(c, \coprod_{a\in A} c), C(c, d))$.
As we have already seen, any hom-set in the codomain of such an arrow yields the
colimit cone under $\bar{A}$, up to unique isomorphism. Therefore, all arrows $C(c, \coprod_{a\in A} c)\to C(c, d)$
define cocones under $\bar{A}$ with nadir $d$, factoring uniquely through the colimit
cone under $\bar{A}$. Furthermore, all cones under $\bar{A}$ with nadir $d$ must
factor uniquely through the colimit cocone under $\bar{A}$, so the hom-set $\text{Set}(C(c, \coprod_{a\in A} c), C(c, d))$
is exactly the set of cocones $\text{Cone}(\bar{A}, d)$. But a colimit is
a representation for a certain cone functor; in particular, $\coprod_{a\in A} c$
represents $Cone(\bar{A}, -)$. Hence</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">
C(\coprod_{a\in A} c, d)\cong Cone(\bar{A}, d)\cong \text{Set}(C(c, \coprod_{a\in A} c), C(c, d))
</script></div>

<p>By the Yoneda lemma, this isomorphism is given precisely by $C(c, -)\cong F$. $\square$</p>

<h2 id="45vii-characterizations-of-reflective-subcategories">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#45vii-characterizations-of-reflective-subcategories"></a>(4.5.vii) Characterizations of reflective subcategories</h2>

<p>$\text{Premise}.$ Consider a reflective subcategory inclusion $D\hookrightarrow{}C$ with
reflector $L\colon C\rightarrow D$.</p>

<p>Recall that a $D$ is a reflective subcategory of $C$ if $D$ is a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/full+subcategory">full
subcategory</a> and the inclusion
of $D$ admits a left adjoint $L$, which we call a reflector. This is definition
4.5.12 in Riehl.</p>

<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/assets/img/cat4.5-4.6/reflective-subcategory.png" width="15%"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>Let us denote the unit of this adjunction by $\eta\colon 1_{C}\Rightarrow L$ and the counit
by $\epsilon\colon L\Rightarrow 1_D$; for now we elide the inclusion functor, for its
presence in the domain definitions of the unit and counit acts as the identity.</p>

<p>Note also that because the inclusion $D\hookrightarrow C$ is fully faithful,
<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+functor#FullyFaithfulAndInvertibleAdjoints">$\epsilon$ is a natural isomorphism</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, let’s get started.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>$\text{Part (i).}$ Show that $\eta L = L\eta$, and that these natural transformations are isomorphisms.</p>

<p>$\text{Proof.}$ By the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/triangle+identities">triangle identities</a>,
$1_L = \epsilon L \circ L\eta$. Since $1_L$ and $\epsilon L$ are natural isomorphisms,
we must have that $L\eta$ is a natural isomorphism.</p>

<p>Now consider the following triple of squares, each of which commutes either by
the naturality of the unit or the counit.</p>

<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/assets/img/cat4.5-4.6/commute-triple.png" width="100%"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>Commutativity of the first square, which holds for all objects $c\in C$, tells
us that $\epsilon L = L\epsilon$. Commutativity of the second and third squares
imply $\epsilon L \circ L\eta = L \epsilon \circ \eta L = \epsilon L \circ \eta
L$, and so $L\eta = \eta L$. Furthermore, $\eta L$ is a natural transformation
because $L\eta$ is. $\square$</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>$\text{Part (ii).}$ Show that an object $c\in C$ is in the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/essential+image"><strong>essential image</strong></a> of the inclusion
$D\hookrightarrow C$, meaning that it is isomorphic to an object in the subcategory $D$,
if and only if $\eta_c$ is an isomorphism.</p>

<p>$\text{Proof.}$ First, suppose $C\ni c\cong d\in D$, and that this isomorphism
is given by $\phi\colon c\to d$. For clarity, we will denote the inclusion functor $\iota\colon D\hookrightarrow C$.
By the triangle identities, we have that $1_\iota = \iota\epsilon\circ\eta\iota$;
this implies $\eta\iota$ is a natural isomorphism. Now consider the square</p>

<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/assets/img/cat4.5-4.6/commute-phi-eta.png" width="30%"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>which commutes by the naturality of $\eta$. $\eta_{\iota d}$, $\phi$, and $L\phi$ are
isomorphisms, so $\eta_c$ is an isomorphism.</p>

<p>Conversely, supposing $\eta_c\colon c\to Lc$ is an isomorphism, $\eta_c$ defines
an isomorphism between $c$ and $Lc\in D$. $\square$</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>$\text{Part (iii).}$ Show that the essential image of $D$ consists of those
objects $c$ that are <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/local+object"><strong>local</strong></a> for
the class of morphisms that are inverted by $L$. That is, $c$ is in the
essential image if and only if the pre-composition functions</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">
C(b,c)\xrightarrow{f^*} C(a,c)
</script></div>

<p>are isomorphisms for all maps $f\colon a\to b$ in $C$ for which $Lf$ is an
isomorphism in $D$.</p>

<p>$\text{Proof.}$ Suppose that the class of pre-composition functions as described
above, consisting of those functions whose image under $L$ are isomorphisms, are
isomorphisms in $C$. Taking $c\in C$, we have that $L\eta_c$ is an isomorphism
by $\text{(i)}$, and hence in particular $C(Lc,c)\xrightarrow{\eta_c}C(c,c)$
yields an isomorphism. This implies $\exists ! f\colon Lc\to c$ such that
$f\eta_c = 1_c$. By the naturality of $\eta$, the square</p>

<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/assets/img/cat4.5-4.6/commute-eta-f.png" width="30%"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>commutes, yielding the equivalence</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">
1_{Lc} = L(1_c) = L(f\circ\eta_c) = Lf\circ L\eta_c = Lf \circ\eta_{Lc}=\eta_c\circ f
</script></div>

<p>Hence $\eta_c$ and $f$ are inverse isomorphisms. But $\eta_c$ being an
isomorphism implies $c$ is in the essential image of $D$.</p>

<p>Conversely, supposing $c\in C$ is in the essential image of $D$, we have that
$\exists d\in D$ with isomorphisms $\phi\colon c\leftrightarrows d\colon \phi^{-1}$.
Let $f\colon a\to b\in C$ be such that $Lf$ is an isomorphism. Then by the
definition of adjunction, the square</p>

<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/assets/img/cat4.5-4.6/commute-iso-f.png" width="30%"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>commutes. Since $Lf$ is an isomorphism, $(Lf)^*$ is an isomorphism, and so $f^*$
must be an isomorphism as well. Hence</p>

<div class="mathblock"><script type="math/tex; mode=display">
f^{*} = {\phi^{-1}}_{*}\circ f^{*}\circ\phi_{*}\colon\;C(b,c)\to C(a,c)
</script></div>

<p>is an isomorphism of hom-sets, satisfying the proposition
hypothesis. $\square$</p>

<p>As Riehl points out, this last construction indeed describes why the reflector
$L$ can be described as a <strong>localization</strong>. Indeed, the left adjoint $L$
determines the essential image of a reflective subcategory via a particular
universal property that inverts local morphisms.</p>
